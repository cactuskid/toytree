A simple way to get started with using and learning `toytree` is to jump
inside an interactive Jupyter notebook and to follow along with the tutorials
in the documentation.

In fact, you can even try out `toytree` before installing it by launching
an interactive notebook server running in the cloud that has `toytree` and
many example notebooks pre-installed and loaded. Simply click the link below.
