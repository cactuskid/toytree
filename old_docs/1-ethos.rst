The toytree ethos
=================

Welcome to **toytree**, a Python library for tree visualization and manipulation. 

Toytree is designed for interactive use within jupyter notebooks, and makes use
of modern Python and web development features that make it easy to learn and use. 
It is an object-oriented library, built upon inspiration for a Python-based tree
object similar to `ete3 <http://etetoolkit.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial_trees.html>`_,
but with modern graphical design elements from `toyplot <http://toyplot.rtfd.io>`__. 
It has since expanded into a more expansive library for tree manipulation and plotting, 
towards the likes of the R packages 'ape' and 'phytools'. A goal of toytree is to
promote further development of phylogenetic and tree-based methods in Python.

Toytree Goals:  

+ **style**: beautiful "out-of-the-box‚Äù figures that require minimal styling.
+ **customization**: extensive style options using CSS semantics. 
+ **simplicity**: several pre-defined plotting styles (e.g., coalescent, dark-mode).
+ **tree manipulation**: easily traversable class object. Rooting, ordering, etc.
+ **tree statistics**: edge lengths, node heights.
+ **tree comparisons**: cloud tree plotting, Robinson-Fould's calculations.
+ **transparency**: interactive plots make raw data available as pop-ups.
+ **reproducibility**: code and plots in jupyter notebooks.
+ **extendability**: combine with toyplot scatterplots, barplots, colormapping, etc.
+ **minimalism**: lightweight, easy installation.
